PE Parser (Slipstream?) TODOS

==March 12, 2010==

1. Pick a name for this project.  I like Slipstream, so I'm going to go with it as the working name for now.
   PEParser works as well.

2. Start including data definitions for the meanings of the various stuff included.  That is to say, abstract off of the uses of straight up "Words" in the structures, they're not readable, and many of them aren't useful.  It would be better if we replaced them with meaningful ADTs.

3. Pull out the runnable portions of the program and convert them to some kind of x86 assembly.

4. Dump the data sections of the file in some meaningful way.

5. Dump import tables in a meaningful way.

6. Dump export tables " "

7. Add support for non image (executable) files.
